<h1><b><i>STAN LEE'S LIFE COMIC</i></b></h1>

<div>

<p>Since from 2000's, marvel became a obsession to so many people around the globe. We all love IronMan, Captain America, Hulk, Thor and many more marvel characters and we will keep'em loving more and more. As so many of us know that, a movie is a hardwork of so many talented people working together, let it be physically or mentally. Well, we are all enjoying the fruits of marvel studios very very much, but have you ever wondered that "What's the beginning of all of this?" "Who started it in the first place?" "Whose willpower and convention made marvel studios uncomparable to all other movie francheises ?" </p>
